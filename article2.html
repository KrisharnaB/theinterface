                <p><i>Encryption: The first lock</i></p>
                <p><br>Encryption does not only involve unscrambling information. In order to access its contents, the person intercepting the message should first have the key. One of the earliest forms of encryption is the scytale device used by ancient Spartians to relay war commands secretly. The scytale delivers messages by wrapping a strip of leather around a uniquely shaped wooden rod only known by the intended recipient. When unwrapped only an anagram with meaningless letters are observed, this is the idea behind ciphertext. However, since no lock ever remains unpicked, the frequency analysis system which Islamic scholars used to unravel the Quran was able to piece together cryptography methods such as the scytale device. Frequency analysis relies on the statistical frequency of a letter within a language. For instance, in 2020, ‘E’ is recorded to appear in 10.98% of words, ‘I’ in 9.08% and S in 8.89%. Hence the Islamic scholars would assume that the most common letter in an encrypted message would be E. However, this method of decryption does have its weaknesses. The message “yacht and xylophones” contains the least frequent letters ‘y’ and ‘x’. The caesar cypher relies on shifting letters to infrequent ones with a key code agreed between the sender and recipient. This ultimately started the perpetual battle between encryption and decryption.</p>

                <p><br><i>Data breaching: Picking the Locks</i></p>
                <p><br>It is easy to understand that it is far more easy to make than to break locks. However, does this mean that encryption should only be a concern after a cryptology method has been deciphered? Absolutely not. Neither we nor Influential companies would entrust confidential information to our computers if we are aware that third parties could eavesdrop into secrets at any moment. This is why even though quantum hacking still remains as a threat of the distant future, we must search for a way to stall or overcome this ‘cyberspace doomsday’. Currently, the mission for the ‘lock makers’ is to be solving the common ‘picking’ problem instead of a rare situation when the attacker breaks the entire lock. For instance, it would be more beneficial for cybersecurity analysts to strengthen the security of hashing than to solve data breaches through brute force, since brute force attacks, while unpredictable, are unlikely to succeed. But what happens if the speed of computers continues to increase? This would allow trillions of passwords to be guessed in a millisecond. Will passwords become useless anytime soon?</p>
                <p><br><i>Future of passwords</i></p>
                <p><br>Now this begs the question, will our ‘secrets’ soon have no place to hide? Perhaps, but quantum hacking currently faces a problem that can’t be addressed in the near future. Quantum computers are incredibly expensive to maintain as to retain the ability for these computers to store ‘0’s and ‘1’s simultaneously, quantum computers should be kept at near absolute-zero temperatures. The energy (heat) generated when testing possibilities of passwords causes qubits (bits which store 0s and 1s simultaneously) to resolve at a definite state. This means that (currently) quantum computers still require an impractical duration of time to brute force possibilities of passwords. This means that in the near future, passwords will be required to be longer and more complex. Instead of relying on people like us to remember an essay for a password, more complex means of encryption will be integrated within fingerprints and face recognition (biometrics). This is why Google is introducing a ‘future without passwords’ (passwords that are challenging for a human to remember and guess are currently deterring computers as well). Hence, in the near future, passwords will be made more secure and convenient as a glance at our phones will keep the secret safe.</p>

                In February, NewScientist released an article explaining the intention of researchers to use locusts as bomb sniffers. Of course, locusts have not evolved to detect bombs and certainly do not have the capability to directly communicate to scientists of their findings. However, locusts do have the ability to identify specific smells, a characteristic enhanced if locusts travel in swarms. To utilise this trait, scientists got creative: the article by NewScientist explains how researchers plan to hijack the olfactory system of locusts by attaching biosensors to analyse the neurons being fired when these locusts are placed in a target location. There are several implications of this research. For instance, it isn’t new to us to understand that all tools can be used as weapons, in this case, using the characteristics of locusts to discover ways bombs can go undetected. However, another implication is the use of living organisms as ‘tools’. A commentary by MedicalDiscoveryNews on this research points out that locusts are great for this job as they are “disposable and inexpensive”. Can the same be said of a human?

              <p class="blog-text">
                The gaming industry has transformed into one of the most lucrative sectors worldwide, largely due to its adept application of behavioural psychology. By crafting game mechanics that align with players' psychological motivations, developers create systems that not only captivate players but also encourage significant spending. Hence the question, how has this come to be?              </p>
